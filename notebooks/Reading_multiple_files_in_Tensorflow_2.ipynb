    "In this post, we will read multiple `.csv` files into Tensorflow using generators. But the method we will discuss is general enough to work for other file formats as well. We will demonstrate the procedure using 500 `.csv` files. These files have been created using random numbers. Each file contains only 1024 numbers in one column. This method can easily be extended to huge datasets involving thousands of `.csv` files. As the number of files becomes large, we can't load the whole data into memory. So we have to work with chunks of it. Generators help us do just that conveniently. In this post, we will read multiple files using a custom generator.\n",

First, a folder named \"random_data\" will be created in current working directory and `.csv` files will be saved in it. Subsequently files will be read from that folder and processed. Just make sure that your current working directory doesn't have an old folder named \"random_data\". Then run the following codes.

    "Until now, we have evaluated our model on a kept out test set. For our test set, both data and labels were known. So we evaluated its performance. But often times, for test set, we don't have access to true labels. Rather we have to make predictions on the data available. This is the case in online competitions where we have to submit our predictions on a test set for which don't know the labels. We will call this set (without any labels) the prediction set. This naming convention is arbitray but we will stick with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the whole of our prediction set fits into memory, we can just call `model.predict()` on this data and then use `np.argmax()` to obtain predicted class labels. Otherwise, we can read files in prediction set in chunks, make predictions on the chunks and finally append our result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another pedantic way of doing this is to write a generator to read files from the prediciton set in chunks and make predictions on it. We will show how this approach works. As we don't have a prediction set yet, we will first create some files and save it to the prediction set."

The 5 dimensional output vector for an input add to 1. So it can be interpreted as probability. Thus we should classify the input to a class, for which prediction probability is maximum. To get the class corresponding to maximum probability, we can use `np.argmax()` command."

    "This brings us to the end of the blog. As we had planned in the beginning, we have created random data files, a generator, and trained a model using that generator. The above code can be tweaked slightly to read any type of files other than `.csv`. And now we can train our model without worrying about the data size. Whether the data size is 10GB or 750GB, our approach will work for both.\n",

    "As a final note, I want to stress that, this is not the only approach to do the task. As I have mentioned previously, in `Tensorflow`, you can do the same thing in several different ways. The approach I have chosen seemed natural to me. I have neither strived for efficiency nor elegance. If readers have any better idea, I would be happy to know of it.\n",

    "**Update**: If along with reading, one has to perform complex transformations on extracted data (say, doing spectrogram on each segment of data, etc.), the naive approach presented in this blog may turn out to be slow. But there are ways to make these computations faster. The author himself achieved 10x speedup as compared to naive implementation in one application. If you run into this problem and are unable to solve it, contact the author. A blog discussing this speedup technique will be posted later.\n",
